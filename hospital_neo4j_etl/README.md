# Neo4j Graph Database

## High Level Overview of Graph Database
Graph databases, such as Neo4j, are databases designed to represent and process data stored as a graph. Graph data consists of nodes, edges or relationships, and properties. Nodes represent entities, relationships connect entities, and properties provide additional metadata about nodes and relationships.

Storing data in graph has serveral advantages:
1. **Simplicity:** Modeling real-world relationships between entities is natural in graph databases, reducing the need for complex schemas that require multiple join operations to answer queries.

2. **Relationships:** Graph databases excel at handling complex relationships. Traversing relationships is efficient, making it easy to query and analyze connected data.

3. **Flexibility:** Graph databases are schema-less, allowing for easy adaptation to changing data structures. This flexibility is beneficial for evolving data models.

4. **Performance:** Retrieving connected data is faster in graph databases than in relational databases, especially for scenarios involving complex queries with multiple relationships.

5. **Pattern Matching:** Graph databases support powerful pattern-matching queries, making it easier to express and find specific structures within the data.
